    <h2>Current Problems:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The pressure gradient inside the fluid is remarkably flat.</li>
      <li>The assumption is that the isopycnals are moving horizontally forward.</li>
      <li>Material is not flowing out uniformly; it's pushing out ahead of the intrusion itself.</li>
      <li>The density ahead of the intrusion is almost the same as the density of the intrusion.</li>
      <li>The flow is not as excited about going forward as expected from theory.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
    <p>To see if the density in front of the intrusion matches the intrusion itself:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, plot relevant data to compare density.</li>
      <li>Perform further analysis on the pressure gradient and fluid flow behavior.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p class="formatted-text">
    What we see is that there is a spring region (?) that appears in front of the intrusion, which may be a factor that slows down the flow compared to the shallow water model ?	<br>
  Figure 2 interests me as it seems like the internal waves generated by the fluid happen at the interface of the fluid and the ambient. However, if we observe the isopycnals and how they're moving, the behavior is also very similar. Does this mean that the stratification also generates the perturbations and waves that can drive/move the density layers (look at the velocity vectors in Figure 2)? Is it possible that the internal waves generated by these phenomena are also a factor in slowing down the flow closer to the left end boundary?
	</p>
    <p>
      I also tried to see if there are any big differences in the isopycnals displacements.

    Here were are plotting y+ c(x_0,y,t) against y for different slices of x_values. In one of our assumptions, we assume that the ambient density stratification remains fixed at c = -y. But by looking at the figures and Video 1, I do think this assumption is not really accurate and may be the main cause for the discrepancy. The question is, how does the perturbations of the ambient density contribute to slow down the intrusion process.

    The following is just a video created on from the intrusion height h and average velocity profile u and I plotted the values of u/h at x/t = 0.25. Was unsure what to get out of this, we can discuss this tomorrow.
